# # Challenge-11-Note-Board-Jacqueline-Obeidzinski
## Description
This is Jaci Obeidzinski's Challenge for Module 11. The landing page will have a title with a button below that takes you to the notes page. On the notes page you can see previously added note as well as add new ones. When you enter both a title and text into the blank spots for the new notes then a save button will apear in the top right of the page. 

## How to Install
First you will need to clone this repo onto your personal devise to make to make your notes personal. When you have the files open you will need to do a "npm i" in the terminal. When that is done installing then you can run it using the "node server.js" command. Then you will just need to go to the link that appears in the terminal to go to the landing page.
